Impatience backports a few 1.14 features to 1.13.

Currently included:

- Scaffolding (not made with bamboo, climbable, breaking the bottom block will break all connected scaffolds)

Coming soon:

- New stairs, walls, and slabs
- New recipes for smooth stone, quartz, and sandstone

Might be included:

- New trees
- Bamboo
- Crossbows (with enchantments)
- Berry bushes
- Lectern
- Alternate wood signs

Will not be included:

- Any 1.14 mobs (foxes, new villagers, pillagers, pillager beasts)
- Blaze3D (no)
- Whatever the hell bartek is doing (I still don't know what's going on there)
- Better book editing (sorry)
- White, black, and blue dyes (really difficult to do in a cross-compat way)
- Bamboo forest biomes (I don't wanna fuck up people's worlds)
- Looms (probably, it'd be difficult)
- The new resource pack (just download it yourself)
